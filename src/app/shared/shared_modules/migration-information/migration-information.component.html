				We hope that you are satisfied with the SimpleVM platform. Since the early days of the de.NBI Cloud in 2017, we,
				the de.NBI Cloud Portal Team, have been working tirelessly to improve the user experience and develop features
				that help you to focus on your research while using the de.NBI Cloud. Due to the growing complexity of SimpleVM
				as part of the de.NBI Cloud Portal, we have decided that SimpleVM will continue to live as its own independent
				software. This will also allow the SimpleVM stack to run independently of the de.NBI organization. We will start
				migrating SimpleVM projects from the old platform to the new one.
				<hr />
				<strong>What does this mean for you and your project?</strong><br />

				Once your project has been migrated, you can only control your resources via the new platform. You will have
				access to the same resources you requested.
				<hr />
				<strong>Will all projects be migrated?</strong><br />

				Sooner or later all projects will be migrated, but we will start with the standard projects and continue with
				workshop and cluster projects with special project settings. Please feel free to contact us if you have any
				questions.
