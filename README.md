# Cloud Portal Web App 

This app provides access to the Portal-API and to the Perun API. 

## Production

### Run

You can run the webapp using docker:

~~~BASH
docker run -e ANGULAR_MODE=prod -p 80:80 denbicloud/cloud-portal-webapp:RELEASE
~~~

You can find current releases on GitHub.

**Note**: The cloud-api server must also be running.

## Development

### Project Setup

1. Clone the cloud-portal-webapp repository.
~~~BASH
git clone -b dev https://github.com/deNBI/cloud-portal-webapp.git
cd cloud-portal-webapp
~~~

2. Add this line to your /etc/hosts file 
~~~BASH
127.0.0.1 portal-dev.denbi.de
~~~

3. Install nodejs virtual environment as decribed [here](https://github.com/ekalinin/nodeenv#install).

4. Run the Makefile
~~~BASH
make
~~~
The default target checks if steps 1 - 3 were executed and then creates a node-environment, followed by installing all needed npm packages and angular cli (by running npm install and npm install -g @angular/cli).
For more makefile targets run help.
~~~BASH
make help
~~~

5. Start the angular server with make or by yourself
~~~BASH
make serve
~~~
or
~~~BASH
. env/bin/activate
ng serve
~~~

the dev server should run now on portal-dev.denbi.de:8001. 
The app will automatically reload if you update any of the source files.

### Debug with Intellij

You must first setup and start the project as described in the **Project Setup** section.

#### 2.Enable Javascript debugging

Enable Javascript debugging by choosing JavaScript Debug in your Run/Debug configurations

![Debug Configurations](images/run_debug_configuration.png)

#### 3. Once you start the Debug mode a browser window should pop up. 

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

### Documentation

We are using [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/guides/getting-started.html) to visualize the code written in TypeScript-files. 

#### Installation

* You can install Compodoc with npm:
~~~BASH
npm install
~~~

#### Usage

* Comment your code written in TypeScript-files. Comment-syntax is equivalent to Javascript.

Example: 
```javascript
  /**
   * Uses the data from the application form to fill the confirmation-modal with information.
   * @param f the application form with corresponding data
   */
  filterEnteredData(f: NgForm) ***REMOVED***
  ...
```

* Use the following commands to let Compodoc analyze the written code and comments.
~~~BASH
npm run compodoc
~~~

* To view the created documentation, use your favorite webbrowser (e.g. firefox)
~~~BASH
firefox documentation/overview.html
~~~
